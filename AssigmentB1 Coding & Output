Coding:
package assigment;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class assigmentB1 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		
		int years, LoanAmount;// make sure its output an integer
		double SimpleIntrest, MonthlyPayment, TotalPayment;//make sure its output a double
		
		Scanner scanMe = new Scanner (System.in);// to enter input from user
		
		System.out.println("Enter yearly interest rate, for example 3.5: ");
		SimpleIntrest = scanMe.nextDouble();//use nextDouble for double
		
		System.out.println("Enter number of years as an integer, for example 5: ");
		years = scanMe.nextInt();//use nextInt for int
		
		System.out.println("Enter loan amount, for example 3000.00: ");
		LoanAmount = scanMe.nextInt();
		
		MonthlyPayment = SimpleIntrest * 30;// to calculate ammount of  Monthylypayment //30 days for every months
		TotalPayment = MonthlyPayment * (5 * 12);//to calculate ammount of TotalPayment // 12 because a year consist of 12 months
		
		System.out.println("The monthly payment is $" + MonthlyPayment);
		System.out.println("The total payment is $" + TotalPayment);

	}

}


Output:
Enter yearly interest rate, for example 3.5: 
3.5
Enter number of years as an integer, for example 5: 
5
Enter loan amount, for example 3000.00: 
3000
The monthly payment is $105.0
The total payment is $6300.0
